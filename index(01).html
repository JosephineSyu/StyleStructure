            JOEL
            (calling after her)
            I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
            
            VOICE-OVER
            I didn't want to go. I was too nervous.
            I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting.
            You called from upstairs.
            
            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
            (flat)
            So go.
            
            JOEL
            I did. I walked out the door.
            I felt like I was a scared little kid.
            I thought you knew that about me.
            I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation.
            You said, "so go" with such disdain.
            
            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
            (poking her head downstairs)
            What if you stay this time?
            
            JOEL
            I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
            
            CLEMENTINE
            Come back and make up a good-bye at least.
            Let's pretend we had one.
            
            Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her way through the decaying environment.
            
            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
            Bye, Joel.
            
            JOEL
            I love you.
            
            She smiles. They kiss. It fades.
